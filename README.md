How to work:

After using the Makefile to compile, type "./tsh" to to begin the shell.

Shell commands:

1) instagram
	Typing this will retrieve information from a hard coded instagram file. This showcases our ability to connect to instagram through the shell.

2) msc [IMAGE BEING TRANSFORMED] [NUMBER OF COLUMNS] [NUMBER OF ROWS] [FOLDER WITH THUMB PICTURES]
	Given a picture, dimensions, and a collection of smaller pictures, we can make a mosaic out of any image.

3) etch [IMAGE BEING TRANSFORMED]
	Given a picture, we can change any image to be purely black and white.

4) shrpn [IMAGE BEING TRANSFORMED]
	Given a picture, we can remove blur on an image and "sharpen" it's appearance.

To do (What was not completed):

We hoped to have a few more filters for the final project.

We also hoped to download images from instagram profiles, either downloading images one-by-one, or altogether. Also, if downloaded altogether, they could have been made into thumbnails and used for mosaics. This could not get accomplished as we could not figure out how to download images after using the instagram API. 

And finally, we hoped to be able to upload images to instagram, but the API does not allow this.
